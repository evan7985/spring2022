# Cheatsheet

Patterns and examples of how to accomplish frequent tasks. We will build up
this section together over the course of the semester. 

Delete an empty directory:
```
rmdir directory
```

Since you can't delete a directory with files in it you need to recursively delete the folder and its contents. The ```-R``` is a recursive declaration which tells the terminal to delete the folder, the files within the folder, subfolders, files in the subfolder etc. [Source](https://www.macworld.com/article/222596/command-line-deleting-files-folders-mac-terminal.html)

Delete everything in a directory without confirmation:
```
rm -R directory
```
The ```-i``` is a flag that prompts you if you want to remove each separate file in the directory.

Delete everything in a directory with confirmation:
```
rm -iR directory
```

Move/Rename a file/folder:
```
mv file/folder directory
mv file/folder new_file/folder
```
This will move the file/folder to the directory you want it to be in. This can also change the name of the file/folder by replacing the directory with the desired new file/folder name.
